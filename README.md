# Portfolio Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis in Python

## Overview

This project implements a **historical scenario-based stress testing framework** for an equity portfolio using Python and real market data.

The objective is to evaluate **portfolio losses under major financial crises** and demonstrate practical applications of **market risk analytics aligned with FRM concepts**.

## Stress Scenarios Covered

* Global Financial Crisis (2008)
* China Market Slowdown (2015–2016)
* COVID-19 Market Crash (2020)
* Global Rate-Hike Cycle (2022)

## Methodology

1. Download historical equity prices using `yfinance`
2. Compute daily returns for each security
3. Apply historical crisis-period shocks to current portfolio prices
4. Estimate **portfolio-level stressed P&L**
5. Visualize scenario losses using Python charts

## Key Features

* Historical stress testing framework
* Scenario-based portfolio loss estimation
* Real market data integration
* Data visualization with Matplotlib
* Reproducible Python workflow

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* pandas, numpy
* yfinance
* matplotlib

## Learning Outcomes

* Practical implementation of **market risk stress testing**
* Understanding of **scenario analysis in portfolio management**
* Application of **FRM market risk concepts using Python**

## Future Enhancements

* Historical VaR and CVaR estimation
* Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio risk
* Risk contribution analysis by asset
* Automated reporting dashboard
